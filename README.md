# The Quiet Before the Storm: NYC's Pandemic Noise Story

A data visualization website exploring how COVID-19 transformed New York City's noise complaints patterns during 2019-2020.

## Project Overview

This website tells a narrative data visualization story about NYC's noise complaint patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis revealed a fascinating "Quiet Before the Storm" pattern where the city initially experienced a "Great Quiet" during lockdown (March-May 2020) as complaints dropped, followed by a dramatic "Noise Awakening" during reopening where complaints surged far beyond pre-pandemic levels.

The website follows an Interactive Slideshow format that guides visitors through key findings while allowing interactive exploration at specific points.

## Website Structure

The website is organized into the following sections:

1. **Landing Header**: Introduction to the narrative and visualization concept
2. **The Three-Phase Story**: Overview of pandemic noise patterns
3. **The Great Quieting**: Analysis of the initial lockdown impact
4. **Borough Disparities**: Exploration of uneven impacts across NYC
5. **The Noise Awakening**: Examination of the post-lockdown surge
6. **Explore the Transformation**: Interactive tools for data exploration
7. **Key Findings & Implications**: Summary and takeaways
